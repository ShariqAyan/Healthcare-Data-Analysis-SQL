# Healthcare-Data-Analysis-and-Patient-History-Management-Using-SQL
## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
This project analyzes a healthcare database using SQL to extract meaningful insights from interconnected datasets â€” including patient records, doctor information, and hospital admissions.
It simulates 35 real-world data tasks such as identifying trends, updating records, handling NULLs, calculating BMI, and evaluating patient distributions across provinces and diagnoses. This project showcases the ability to work with structured data for practical decision-making in a healthcare context.

# ðŸ’¡ Key Insights & Examples
- Patients diagnosed with Dementia and treated by specific doctors
- Provincial distribution of patients and height/weight metrics
- Most common allergies and their frequency
- Birth trends by year and city-level patient clustering
- Patient weight groups and obesity classification (using BMI)

# ðŸ›  SQL Concepts Demonstrated
- JOIN operations across patients, admissions, doctors, and province_names
- CASE statements and conditional logic
- Data cleaning using UPDATE and IS NULL
- Grouping and aggregation (GROUP BY, HAVING, COUNT, SUM)
- String operations (CONCAT, LOWER, UPPER)
- Date filtering and formatting (YEAR(), DAY())
